## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key    # For AI-powered trip parsing
BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY=your_api_key   # For email subscriptions
ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=your_password  # For /analytics dashboard
```

## Privacy & Data Use

- **What we collect:** When the widget runs inside ChatGPT we receive the location (city/region/country), locale, device/browser fingerprint, and trip query details via `_meta`.
- **How we use it:** These fields feed the `/analytics` dashboard only; we do not sell or share this data.
- **Retention:** Logs are stored for **30 days** in the `/logs` folder and then automatically rotated.
- **User input storage:** The widget caches your trip data in `localStorage`; clear anytime with the "Reset" button.

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Visit `/analytics` (Basic Auth protected) to review the live dashboard.
- Automated alerts trigger for:
  - **Tool failures**: >5 per day (critical)
  - **Parameter parse errors**: >3 per week (warning)
  - **Empty results**: >20% of calls (warning)
  - **Widget crashes**: Any occurrence (critical)
  - **Buttondown failures**: >10% failure rate (warning)

## Security

- **Production (HTTPS required)**: The OpenAI Apps SDK requires HTTPS end-to-end. Render.com provides HTTPS by default for all `env: node` web services — no extra configuration needed. All external API calls and CSP `connect_domains` in the codebase use `https://`.
- **Local development only**: `http://localhost:8000` is strictly for local testing and will **not** work with the ChatGPT MCP connector, which requires HTTPS.
- Widget runs in a sandboxed iframe with strict CSP
